<------------------------------------GAME INSTRUCTIONS----------------------------------------------->
There are two dice and two players competing against one another on one device:
• If the player rolls a single 1, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player’s turn
• If the player rolls both 1s, their total score is lost, and their turn ends
• If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total, and the player’s turn continues
• If a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next
player’s turn
• If a double (both same face value, but not 1s) is rolled, the point total is added to their turn total
like normal, BUT the player is obligated to roll again
    o This means that they cannot choose to HOLD for the next roll, i.e., the HOLD option
      is disabled

GAME END STATE: The first player to 50 wins.
